# Minor Personal Corrections or Differing Opinions to Material presented in CLRS

The authors of the book present a concept in a certain way. This certain way could be improved upon in some cases. This does not mean the authors did a terrible job at
writing the book. It just means that I found a different way, perhaps a bit more precise or clearer, to present their material.


#### Ch2 Page 17
- Section 2.1: "Our first algorithm, insertion sort, solves the sorting problem introduced in Chapter 1" 
- I think the sentence above should read: Our first algorithm, insertion sort, __provides a way to solve__ the sorting problem introduced in 
Chapter 1." 

#### Ch2 Page 17
- "We start with insertion sort, which is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements."
- I think the above sentence should read: We start with insertion sort, __which just like bubble sort,__ is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements.
