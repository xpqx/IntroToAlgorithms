# IntroToAlgorithms (xpqx version)
repo for solutions to the famous algorithms book "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen et al.

# Goals

The goals are to have pseudocode from the book in c++ or java or lua.
Lua is a language that functions almost like the pseudocode in the book 
already and it would be ideal to have "runnable pseudocode" in Lua for 
each algorithm and data structure that is presented in the book.

For C++ and Java on the other hand, it would probably be best to have 
the proposed solutions in the OOP. 

Some solutions will be presented using the Ocaml programming language.

For Presentation purposes, we should explore how to write math equations 
on here.

Here's link to an app that helps with that:

Here's a test

![\begin{align*}
R(g) &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ell(y_i,g(x_i))\\
&=\frac{1}{2n} (\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{w}-\mathbf{y})^T (\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{w}-\mathbf{y})
\end{align*}

Looks like it worked! ;-)
